# LabView-Led-Matrix
The project I did for my LabView Course in University displays the current Humidity and Temerature and shows both stats over time. The temperature and humidity get measured by a sensor connected to the Arduiono and get send via the serial connection to the LabView programm running on a PC. The LabView programm calculates the pixels that need to be switched on as well as the colour ands sends this data back to the Arduino. There, the LED-Matrix gets displayed.
