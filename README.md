# LabView-Led-Matrix
The project I did for my LabView course in university displays the current humidity and temperature and shows both stats over time. The temperature and humidity get measured by a sensor connected to the Arduino and get send via the serial connection to the LabView program running on a PC. The LabView program calculates the pixels that need to be switched on as well as the colour and sends this data back to the Arduino. There, the LED-Matrix gets displayed.
All documentation is in German.

This is the prototyping phase of the project. All necessary components are placed on the breadboard and are wired up.

After Collecting multiple points of humidity and temperature data, a spline interpolation is used to display the temperature and humidity with a width of 10 pixels on the matrix. The lowest temperature is visualised in a yellow colour, the maximal temperature is displayed in red.

The current temperature (yellow, 20Â°) and humidity (blue, 63%) are displayed on the display. The colour gets scaled by the maximum and minimum colour measured in the measurement series.

Of cause, the actual use case is a little gimmicky. The graph doesn't show the absolute values only relative values. Also, ten pixels are a bit few. The same goes for the current temperature. One needs to know how the numbers are displayed to be able to read them.
